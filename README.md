Firebase Authentication: User authentication is handled seamlessly using Firebase Authentication. Readers can create accounts, log in securely, and enjoy a personalized experience tailored to their preferences.

Firebase Firestore: To enhance user experience and enable features like personalized booklists and reading progress tracking, Firebase Firestore is employed as a NoSQL cloud database. This allows for real-time data synchronization across devices.

Technology Stack:

Kotlin: The application is developed using Kotlin, a modern and expressive programming language for Android development.

Retrofit: A powerful HTTP client for Android, Retrofit is used to interact with the Google Books API, fetching real-time book data.

Hilt Dagger: Hilt is employed for dependency injection, streamlining the development process and ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.

Firebase: Leveraging Firebase Authentication and Firestore, the application provides a secure and scalable backend infrastructure.
